                <h2>My story starts in small town called Asella...</h2>
                <p>March 2, 2000GC was the day the spark of the sun shined on me. On that day my father Tassew Mekuria
                    and
                    also my mother Fasika Shirkabu
                    had been satisfied with thier life as they were never been before( ofcourse they themselves told
                    me).
                    They have made every thing on their hands
                    to give me a happy, the life they never had. Since my country is on of the countries mentioned as a
                    poor
                    country, there was no life as of the
                    developed countries. Every one was expected to work hard even if their effort didn't offer them the
                    price they deserve. But this didn't stop my
                    parents gave me a childhood time i always wish to go back to it. Their life goal was to make me and
                    my
                    brothers and siters educatted in every
                    possible fields. The softskill i now had and good relation with every one i met had its begining at
                    that
                    first day of my life when GOD put me in
                    the hands of those good people.
                </p>
                <p>In this life of mine i have learned and acquired much skill on computers. Again the effort of my
                    parrents
                    helped me here a lot providing a pc when a TV
                    is prcious to many at the time in my country.
