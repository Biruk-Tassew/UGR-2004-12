                            <p>I am passionate about UI/UX design and Web Design and programming as a whole.
                                I am a skilled front-end developer and also have a good impression of graphic design
                                tools such as Photoshop and Sketch. I am a quick learner and a team
                                worker that gets the job done. I can easily capitalize on low hanging
                                fruits and quickly maximize timely deliverables for real-time schemas.</p>
